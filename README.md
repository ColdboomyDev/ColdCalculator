Repository with code of Calculator Discord bot
I'm trying to make a Discord bot that will help me to calculate financials and write them down to a standartised file.

There are commands (!savings, !left, !thisMonth) that returns specific values from sheet, and commands (!income, !spend) that writes down some values.

To compile this code you need to run proper standartised tutorial setup for discord client and Google_Sheets API and to have files (client_secret, credentials, token, config) in your repository. Also you need to change spreadsheetIds and sheetIds to yours. Don't forget to share permisions to edit spreadsheet with email in client_secret file.
